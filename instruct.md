## AI Engineer Assessment — Customer Support Chatbot

# The Situation

You're an AI engineer at Meridian Electronics, a mid-size company that sells computer products — monitors, keyboards, printers, networking gear, and accessories. The support team currently handles all customer inquiries by phone and email, and leadership wants to explore whether an AI-powered chatbot could handle common requests: checking product availability, helping customers place orders, looking up order history, and authenticating returning customers.
The backend team has already built an internal services layer and exposed it as an MCP server so that an LLM-based chatbot can call into existing business systems without direct database access:

```bash
MCP_SERVER_URL=https://order-mcp-74afyau24q-uc.a.run.app/mcp
Transport: Streamable HTTP
```

Your engineering manager has asked you to build a working prototype and present it to the team by the end of day. The VP of Customer Experience will also be watching — she wants to understand whether this is worth investing in before next quarter's planning.

## Your Assignment

Build a deployable, production-ready prototype of the customer support chatbot. "Production-ready" means: if the demo goes well, engineering should be able to take your code, do a security review, and push it to production without a rewrite. Think clean architecture, appropriate error handling, tested behavior, and thoughtful decisions — not just "does it work."

# Constraints

- LLM: Use a cost-effective model (flash or mini tier — e.g., Gemini Flash, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku). The business case only works if per-conversation costs stay low.
- UI: At minimum, a functional chat interface (Gradio, Streamlit, or equivalent). If you have time, a full UI framework (Next.js, etc.) would strengthen the demo.
- Deployment: At minimum, deploy to HuggingFace Spaces so the team can try it live. Bonus for deployment to Vercel, GCP, AWS, or Azure.
- Scope: Connect to the MCP server, discover its available tools, and build a chatbot that uses them to serve Meridian's customers. The MCP tools define what the chatbot can do — explore them and make sure your bot handles those workflows well.
